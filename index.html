				Hawaii is a U.S. state located in the Pacific Ocean approximately 2,000 mi (3,200 km) from the U.S. mainland. It is the only state outside North America, the only island state, and the only state in the tropics. Hawaii is also one of a few U.S. states to have once been an independent nation.

				Hawaii encompasses nearly the entire Hawaiian archipelago, composed of 137 volcanic islands spanning 1,500 miles (2,400 km), which are physiographically and ethnologically part of the Polynesian subregion of Oceania. The state's ocean coastline is consequently the fourth longest in the U.S., at about 750 miles (1,210 km). The eight main islands, from northwest to southeast, are Niʻihau, Kauaʻi, Oʻahu, Molokaʻi, Lānaʻi, Kahoʻolawe, Maui, and Hawaiʻi, after which the state is named; it is often called the "Big Island" or "Hawaii Island" to avoid confusion with the state or archipelago. The uninhabited Northwestern Hawaiian Islands make up most of the Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, the largest protected area in the U.S. and the third largest in the world.

				Settled by Polynesians some time between 124 and 1120, Hawaii was home to numerous independent chiefdoms. British explorer James Cook was the first known non-Polynesian to arrive at the archipelago in 1778; early British influence is reflected in the design of the state flag. An influx of explorers, traders, and whalers arrived shortly thereafter, introducing diseases that decimated the once-isolated indigenous community. Hawaii became a unified, internationally recognized kingdom in 1810, remaining independent until Western businessmen overthrew the monarchy in 1893; this led to annexation by the U.S. in 1898. As a strategically valuable U.S. territory, Hawaii was attacked by Japan on December 7, 1941, which brought it global and historical significance, and contributed to America's decisive entry into World War II. Hawaii became the most recent state to join the union on August 21, 1959. In 1993, the U.S. government formally apologized for its role in the overthrow of Hawaii's government, which spurred the Hawaiian sovereignty movement.

				<p>
					'The Diary of a Wimpy Kid' books are all about a kid called Greg who fills in his journal (not a diary!!) of all the misadventures in his life.

					Everything Greg seems to do has hilarious consequences and his family are very funny. In this book it is summer vacation and even though it is nice and hot Greg insists on staying inside hooked up to his video games with the blinds drawn. His mother is tired of Greg being lazy and decides that this summer should be fun and packed with family activities.

					This book was very good. My favourite character has to be Greg as he can be horrible but the audience always roots for him anyway! I really like the part when Greg's mum is forgotten by the whole family at a petrol station in the middle of nowhere - it is hilarious.

					I recommend this book to readers around 10-13 who enjoy reading as it is quite easy to read, but it has some challenging words as well.

					I give this a big 5/5 because I enjoyed reading it so much.

					'Harry Potter' books are all about a kid called Harry Potter who goes to a magic school to learn magic with his friends
					
					Harry Potter's parents died so he was adopted and he hated his parents. In this book it is explaining the cool advetures of him and his friends.

					This book was very good. My favourite character is of course Harry Potter because if anything interesting happens, Harry Potter is always in the middle of it.

					I recommend this book to readers around 11-16 who enjoy reading as it is quite hard to read, and it has some challenging words as well.

					I give this a 4/5 because I enjoyed reading.

					'The Last Kids on Earth' books are all about some kids in an apocolypse with zombies and monsters.

					In the books many interesting things happen and the kids are very funny. In this book it is sthe apocolypse and even though it is they are kids, they have to fight for their lives'. It getspretty boring so they come up with fun activities to do.

					This book was very good. My favourite character probably is Jack Suliven.

					I recommend this book to readers around 8-13 who enjoy reading as it is quite easy to read, but it has some challenging words as well.

					I give this a big 5/5 because I enjoyed reading it so much.

				<p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-8 col-xs-12">Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by Mojang. The game was created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language. Following several early test versions, it was released as a paid public alpha for personal computers in 2009 before releasing in November 2011, with Jens Bergensten taking over development. Minecraft has since been ported to several other platforms and is the best-selling video game of all time, with 200 million copies sold and 126 million monthly active users as of 2020.
					<br><br>
					In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally-generated 3D world with infinite terrain, and may discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures or earthworks. Depending on game mode, players can fight computer-controlled "mobs", as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. Game modes include a survival mode, in which players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, and a creative mode, where players have unlimited resources. Players can modify the game to create new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets.
					<br><br>
					Minecraft has been critically acclaimed, winning several awards and being cited as one of the greatest video games of all time. Social media, parodies, adaptations, merchandise, and the annual MineCon conventions played large roles in popularizing the game. It has also been used in educational environments, especially in the realm of computing systems, as virtual computers and hardware devices have been built in it. In 2014, Mojang and the Minecraft intellectual property were purchased by Microsoft for US$2.5 billion. A number of spin-off games have also been produced, such as Minecraft: Story Mode, Minecraft Dungeons, and Minecraft Earth.

				<p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-8 col-xs-12">Roblox is an online game platform and game creation system developed by Roblox Corporation. It allows users to program games and play games created by other users. Founded by David Baszucki and Erik Cassel in 2004 and released in 2006, the platform hosts user-created games of multiple genres coded in the programming language Lua. For most of Roblox's history, it was relatively small, both as a platform and a company, due to both co-founder Baszucki's lack of interest in press coverage and it being "lost among the crowd" in a large number of platforms released around the same time. Roblox began to grow rapidly in the second half of the 2010s, and this growth has been accentuated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
<br><br>
					Roblox is free-to-play, with in-game purchases available through a virtual currency called "Robux". As of August 2020, Roblox had over 164 million monthly active users, with it being played by over half of all children aged under 16 in the United States.</p>

		<p class="p_modal">With a stacked schedule from across England this weekend, Saturday promises a host of eye-catching meetings from up and down the country. So, for those of you looking to stick on a Saturday acca, we have found a handful of helpful tips that are worth keeping an eye out for.
<br>
			<b>Saturday 10th April</b>
<br>
BST 15:00 Derby County vs Norwich City 
<br>
Starting with Saturday’s guests, putting in what was a rampant display earlier in the week, the mood in Norwich’s camp should still be at a red-hot high. Despite losing their Premier League status last summer, The Yellows are have cruised towards an imminent top-flight return this season. Knowing that they could wrap up their promotion charge this weekend, Daniel Farke’s men were last seen picking up a stunning 7-0 romp against Huddersfield last time out. Only continuing on what has been a stellar run of form, the East Anglia outfit are unbeaten in each of their last 12 Championship matchups, a run that stems back to the start of February. More impressive, managing to muster 32 points on their high-flying run of form, the one-time Borussia Dortmund coach will also be boosted by his side’s extended success away from Carrow Road. Unbeaten in their last six away fixtures and winning five of those outings, it’s well worth keeping an eye out for leading marksman Teemu Pukki this weekend. Once again bagging a hat-trick against Huddersfield earlier in the week, the Finland international should be smelling a real chance on Saturday afternoon. On the flip side, while Derby might have enjoyed a real boost after bringing in Wayne Rooney on a permanent basis, The Whites are still looking over their shoulder at the drop zone. Hit with a 3-1 defeat against Reading last time out, this weekend’s hosts have recorded just a single win in their last nine Championship matchups.</p>

		<p class="p_modal">With the Premier League campaign reaching its final stretch, all eyes will soon turn to this summer’s delayed European Championships.
<br>
Watching England opening their World Cup qualifying campaign with victories against San Marino, Albania and Poland, many have started to speculate who could be in Gareth Southgate’s 23-man squad.
<br>
Although there might remain a question mark over who could start between the sticks for England’s opening contest against Croatia at Wembley on June 13th, some stars appear in a real battle to even be rewarded with a spot.
<br>
With Southgate admitting that he has had initial talks with some big names who could be set to miss out, we have taken a look at a handful of heavyweight players who could be spending the summer at home.</p>
